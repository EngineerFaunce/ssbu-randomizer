# SSBU Randomizer

React app for generating a randomized list of fighters in Super Smash Bros Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch. Players will generate a list of fighters meant to be played in order. Upon winning a game, the player moves onto the next character. The goal is to be the first player to win with every fighter (excluding mii's).
